# beyond-origins

RPG written in Java, which is not not using a third-party game engine; <b>everything is from scratch*</b>

The primary objective right now is to have a viable framework, or scaffolding, that is highly configurable and easy to modify. Once finished, an actual storyline, characers and world(s) will be added. There is currently <i>not</i> a timeline.

JavaDoc can be found <a href="https://egartley.net/docs/beyond-origins/?via=githubreadme">here</a> (updated periodically)

• Add sector-to-sector connections (i.e. be able to move from one map sector to another)<br>
• Make better sprites for everything (tree, grass, rock, etc.)

<h2 style="margin-top:36px">Additional Information</h2>

The latest commits will be made to the <a href="https://github.com/egartley/beyond-origins/tree/indev" title="Short for &quot;in-development&quot;"><b>indev</b></a> branch, while major changes or milestones will be merged into the master branch.

This is developed with <a href="https://eclipse.org" title="An open source Java IDE">Eclipse</a>, therefore you will need it in order to build locally. Alternatively, just copy the .java files into your own workflow.

<span>* There may be some libraries used in the future for handling files and parsing JSON data within save files</span>
