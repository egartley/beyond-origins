# Beyond Origins

2D game written in Java, mostly from scratch. There is no specific goal or deadline, and commits will be sporadic. This is not meant to result in anything final or complete, rather it's just something to mess around with from time to time.

See the project's webpage <a href="https://egartley.net/projects/beyond-origins/?via=gh">here</a> for additional information such as screenshots and the JavaDoc.
