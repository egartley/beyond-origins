# Beyond Origins

Rewrite of a game I tried to make a few years ago. This is not using a third-party game engine, <b>everything is from scratch</b>.

The latest commits will be made to the <a href="https://github.com/egartley/beyond-origins/tree/indev">indev</a> branch, while major changes will be merged into the master branch.

See <a href="https://egartley.net/projects/beyond-origins/?via=beyondoriginsgithubreadmemd">https://egartley.net/projects/beyond-origins/</a> for more detailed information

Developed with <a href="https://eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>, so you will need that in order to build locally (unless of course you know how to compile Java from the command line)
