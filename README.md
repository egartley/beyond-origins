# Beyond Origins

2D game written in Java, mostly from scratch. There is no specific goal or deadline, and commits will be sporadic. This is not meant to result in anything complete, rather it's just something to mess around with from time to time. Watch the video linked below for a better look at what is currently implelemented.
