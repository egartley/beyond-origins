# Beyond Origins

Rewrite of an RPG game I tried to make a few years ago. This is not using a third-party game engine - <b>everything is from scratch</b>.

The most recent commits will be made in the <a href="https://github.com/egartley/beyond-origins/tree/indev">indev</a> branch, while major changes will be merged into the master branch.

Most commits are made from Eclipse (<a href="https://eclipse.org">https://eclipse.org</a>)
